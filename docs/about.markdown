A lopsided clockwork bird made of rusty scrap.
A scorched skeletal hand.
An endless sheet of rain.
A fall of light on rough rock and blowing sand.
We are the WorldSwirl. Inhabiting some average-looking human somewhere. Blind and constantly struggling to stay awake, we see the world through eyes both huge and low energy. Come inside.
