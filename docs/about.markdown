# Where am I?

A lopsided clockwork bird made of rusty scrap.

A scorched skeletal hand.

An endless sheet of rain.

A fall of light on rough rock and blowing sand.

We are the WorldSwirl. Inhabiting some average-looking human somewhere. Blind and constantly struggling to stay awake, we see the world through eyes both huge and low energy. After all every one of us comes from a billions year long line that was only in a hurry to get away from something or prepare for winter.

We stream. We make eclectic fragments. Writing. Recording. Playlists. And coming soon, sounds and original music.
